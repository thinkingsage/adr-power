# ADR Power

## Overview

Architecture Decision Records capture significant architectural choices — context, decision, and consequences — in MADR format. This power creates, maintains, and cross-references ADRs: it reads git context, detects duplicates, manages supersession chains, and keeps the index current. Use it when a project makes choices future contributors must understand: module structures, integration patterns, technology selections, or data-flow changes. No configuration beyond a git repository; the ADR directory and changelog tool are auto-discovered.

## Steering Files

Read the matching file when its task arises.

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `workflow` | Any create / update / review / cross-reference task. Includes the MADR templates (full and short-form). Start here. |
| `generate-from-diff` | Drafting an ADR from `git diff` instead of a manual description. |
| `health-check` | Auditing all ADRs for drift, staleness, broken references, and orphaned drafts. |
| `team-review` | Running the review checklist and promotion workflow (Proposed→Accepted). |
| `specs-integration` | Linking ADRs with Kiro specs (requirements / design / tasks). |
| `changelog` | Recording an ADR in the project's changelog tool after a write. |
| `hooks` | Installing native Kiro hooks that auto-enforce ADR creation. |

## Shared Definitions

All steering files reference these.

### Directory
Search order: `docs/adr/` → `docs/decisions/` → `docs/architecture/decisions/` → `docs/`. In monorepos, also check immediate subdirectories (`*/docs/adr/`). None found → propose `docs/adr/`, confirm before creating.

### Naming
`ADR-{NNN}-{kebab-case-title}.md`. Auto-assign the next sequential number from existing files at write time.

### Status
`Draft → Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNN`. Reversing an accepted decision is never an in-place edit — supersede it with a new ADR.

### Git Context
Run before any drafting or analysis:
```bash
git log --oneline -20
git diff --stat HEAD~5..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --stat HEAD
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

### Duplicate Check
Before creating, grep existing ADRs for the decision's key nouns. ≥2 overlaps → offer: supersede the old ADR, amend it, or proceed as unrelated. Wait for the choice before writing.

### Index Maintenance
After every ADR write, update `README.md` in the ADR directory. Exists → append/update the row (status change → update the existing row). Missing → create with the full table, confirm first.
```markdown
| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](./ADR-001-title.md) | Title | Accepted | YYYY-MM-DD |
```

### Cross-Referencing
Supersession updates both files. Relations are added to the Links section of both. Verify every referenced ADR number exists.

### Changelog Check
After every ADR write: fragment tool present (towncrier, changesets, conventional-changelog, release-please, git-cliff, or a `changes/` dir) → use its native format. Else `CHANGELOG.md`/`CHANGES.md`/`HISTORY.md`/`NEWS.md` present → append a link entry. Else → offer to bootstrap `CHANGELOG.md`. Entries are links, never restatements:
```markdown
- [ADR-{NNN}](docs/adr/ADR-{NNN}-{slug}.md): {Title}
```
See `changelog` steering for per-tool formats.

### Templates
Full and short-form MADR templates are in `workflow` steering.

## Rules
1. Git context before drafting.
2. Duplicate-check before creating.
3. Never silently rewrite an accepted decision.
4. Supersession updates both ADRs.
5. No dangling references.
6. Update the index after every write.
7. Draft → confirm → write. Never skip confirmation.
8. Changelog entries are links, not restatements.

## Hooks

Enforcement comes from two automatic hooks; see `hooks` steering for installable native JSON.
- **Session end** (`Stop`): create ADRs for undocumented architectural changes before the session closes.
- **Pre-task** (`PreTaskExec`): create ADRs for new decisions a spec task introduces before implementing.

Hook prompts must be directive — instruct the agent to create the ADR or confirm coverage, not to "suggest" or "keep in mind." Advisory prompts are ignored during autonomous runs.

## Examples

New module → new ADR:
```
Added src/backends/s3.ts (new S3 publishing backend).
→ Create docs/adr/ADR-018-s3-backend-for-artifact-publishing.md
→ Update README.md index row
→ Add changelog fragment
```

Supersession:
```
ADR-012 chose global type fields; ADR-014 repurposes type as taxonomy.
→ ADR-012 status → "Superseded by ADR-014"
→ ADR-014 links back to ADR-012
→ Update both index rows
```

## Edge Cases
- **Duplicate decision**: offer supersede / amend / proceed-as-unrelated. Wait for the choice.
- **Numbering conflict after merge**: renumber the later ADR, update all cross-references.
- **Index merge conflict**: keep both rows, verify numbers, run `health-check`.
- **Hook not firing**: validate the JSON, confirm the `trigger` value, ensure the file is in `.kiro/hooks/`.
